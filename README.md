### Let's practice with Ruby `Classes`!

- Create a class named `Person`.
- What methods (specific actions or behaviors) would a `Person` object have?
- Create a class named `RampUpStudent` that inherits from `Person`.
- What different methods would a `RampUpStudent` have compared to a `Person`?
- Create a class named `RampUpTeachingInstructor` that inherits from `Person`.
- What different methods would a `RampUpInstructor` have as compared to a `RampUpStudent` or a `Person`?
